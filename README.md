# memorySpace

Memory Space is a VR world that allows you to upload memories as a way to re-experience and reflect upon certain moments in your life.

This project uses virtual reality as personal and intimate tool. I created an environment where a user can upload 360 images, videos, or audio recordings of certain experiences in order to be immersed and revisited at a later date. A user can also share their personal “Memory Space” online or with another individual in order to show an intimate part of their life. 

Memory Space is a WebVR application. In this browser-enabled VR world, I constructed a glass box with floating blue spheres, each containing a different memory. Once the user puts on the VR headset, they are able to look around and choose which memory to experience. They simply click on the sphere to view a memory, becoming immersed in that audiovisual story. In order to exit the memory, they simply click again to stop viewing it.

NOTE: download the [WebVR API Emulation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webvr-api-emulation/gbdnpaebafagioggnhkacnaaahpiefil?hl=en) which enables you to run WebVR 1.0 content without having a supported HMD headset or even a compatible browser/platform.

# What's next

I plan to upload my own personal memories to this world and share it. Users will demo certain stories I have uploaded and will be able to ask me questions or leave me comments on my memories. My world will contain both private memories for my own viewing and public memories for people to see. Users will be able to notice a hierarchy between the private/public and between the different "ages" of my memories (a memory from childhood versus a recent memory). I will also add a "visitor counter" to show the IP address and each person that is visiting my world and viewing my memories.
